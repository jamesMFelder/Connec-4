# Connect-4
Lets you play connect-4 with another person or the computer.<br/>
At present only works in a terminal against the computer.
## Issues
Only works in terminal.<br/>
Drifts from top to bottom of terminal.<br/>
Each instance can only play one type of game(computer or two-player)<br/>
The `make install` command only installs on a Linux system.<br/>
## Contributing
Feel free to raise issues(with fixes if possable!).<br/>
I don't know how to set things up for other people to modify the code, but if you ask I will try.
